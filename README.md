  - google_fonts
    - Google Fonts is used to use large variety of fonts available in google to make the application looks beautiful.
    - In this application i used poppins type of google fonts.
  - shared_preferences
    - Shared Preferences is used to store and get the informations in the local device.
    - Here i used shared_preferences to store the counter value to the local memory to reuse the value when the application restart.
    - Here i used shared_preferences to store the themedata in the form of integer and store in the local device and load that value when the application restart. Based on the integer value the theme should be light mode or dark mode.
